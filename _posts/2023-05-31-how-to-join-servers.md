One of the biggest perks for playing on Bedrock or a Java server with Geyser is the potential for cross-play. Bedrock players can join any server running GeyserMC or Bedrock Edition from any console. Most people know this already from playing on PC and Moble, but the process for joining from a Switch or an Xbox requires a few extra steps. Here is a complete breakdown of how to join a Bedrock server from Xbox and Switch so you can join your friends online.

## How to add a Minecraft Server on Xbox:

Joining on Xbox Requires you to change your connection settings. Doing this will give you a new menu from the server page in your game to add a new server. These settings should not affect online play for other games, but you can reset them at any time should you choose to do so.

Open your Xbox settings and select the Network Settings option.

## How to add a Minecraft Server on Nintendo Switch:
The process for joining from Switch is almost identical to setting up on Xbox. You can use the same basic settings used in the Xbox setup. You will also receive the exact same menu to join new servers in the game. These settings should not affect online play for other games, but you can reset them at any time should you choose to do so.

Go to your System Settings and scroll down to the Internet option
Click on the Internet Settings option, choose your current network, and click on Change Settings
Scroll down to the DNS Settings and change it to Manual
For the Primary DNS enter: 104.238.130.180
For the Secondary enter either: 8.8.8.8 or 1.1.1.1
Save the changes and you are ready to go.
 

## Joining the game:
Once you get your connection settings saved you can go ahead and open the game. From there the process to join a server is the same regardless of the console you are using.

Click on Play and go to the Servers tab
Click on any of the pre-added servers on the listadd bedrock server

## Common Issues:
Unable to connect to world:
This is an unfortunately common issue for Bedrock servers. There are not many sure-fire ways to resolve this issue, but here are our recommendations:

Restart your console
Restart your server
Make sure both your game/console and the server are fully updated
If you are using a Java server with Geyser, make sure you have the latest version of the plugin installed and configured correctly. Also make sure you have Floodgate and ViaVersion installed on the server as well.
Change your secondary DNS from 8.8.8.8 to 1.1.1.1 or vice versa
 
The add server menu doesn’t appear:
Change your secondary DNS from 8.8.8.8 to 1.1.1.1 or vice versa. In most cases, switching will allow the menu to pop up as normal.

Wow this server is popular:
This error usually means that the server has too many people on it, or too many connection attempts have been made at once. If you believe that you are getting this in error though, the quickest and easiest way to fix it is to either wait a few minutes, or to just restart the server. The problem will go away once the server comes back up or is no longer getting so many connection attempts at once.

You should also consider raising the player cap of your server from the control panel if you have it set to a low number like 2 or 3.
