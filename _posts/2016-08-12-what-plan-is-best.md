##What do you need from your sever?
Choosing the right hosting plan mostly comes down to one simple thing: What Kind of Server are you making?

If your making a small SMP to play on with your friends, then the Grass plan would most likly work for you, but if lets say your hosting a large anarchy server then a more powerfull plan like the netherite plan would need to be purchased.

##Conclusion

All in all, it all comes down to what you want to do in your server.
